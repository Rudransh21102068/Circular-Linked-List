For traversing through the linked list we stop the traversal when we
reach the first node again. Hence the condition imposed is “temp ==
self.head” .If the condition is True the loop breaks.



def printlist(self):
    temp = self.head
    if self.head is not None:
        while(True):
           print(temp.data, end=" " )
           temp = temp.next
           if (temp == self.head):
               break
